# SofiaAronovFinal

As part of my thesis final project I will be generating an interactive installation which will involve the action from the audience resembling the raise of a curtain. Specific visuals will be then displayed behind the curtain and new ones will apeear everytime the "cloth" will drop down.

A demo of the installation is visible here: https://vimeo.com/194447217/settings/privacy (PASS: curtain).

The process to produce the installation will involve three fases:
* 1 - user detection in space with Kinect
* 2 - **"cloth"like bezier curve algorythm**
* 3 - content visuals behind the curtain

I am now developing the second step, the curve algorythim.
Thsi one is still in progress but functioning: many features must be added to geve a realistic effect.

I generated the algorythimg in Processing and translated it in p5.js.
Both Processing and p5.js sketches are included in the repo.
